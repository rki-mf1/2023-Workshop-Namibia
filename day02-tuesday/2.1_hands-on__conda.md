# Bioinformatics for Influenza Genome Reconstruction: A Hands-On Workshop
# Day 02: Conda

## Lesson Objectives
* Learn to utilize three different conda subcommands

### List all available conda environments
One of the `conda` subcommands is `conda info`.

```bash
# look at all conda environments available to you
conda info --envs
``` 
### Install a new conda environment from a "recipe"
As shown in the lecture conda environments can be summarized in a environment file in YAML format. We will look at one such environment file, then use `conda env` to install it.

```bash
# there are many ways to view a file, we will use cat to do it
cat /home/mf1/nambi24/flu-workflow/envs/bcftools.yaml

# now to install the environment
conda env create -n bcftools -f /home/mf1/nambi24/flu-workflow/envs/bcftools.yaml
```

The `conda env` command was called with the paramteter `-n` which gives the environment the name `bcftools` and with `-f` which tells conda the location of the recipe file.


As a minor exercise, make sure that the environment was installed with the given name (bcftools).
```bash
# look at all conda environments available to you, again

```
